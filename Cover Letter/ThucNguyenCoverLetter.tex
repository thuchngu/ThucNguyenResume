To Whom It May Concern,

\vspace{1em}
After 3 years of undergraduate education and realizing that computer hardware and digital design are my passions, I am looking towards life after my Bachelor's Degree and think that IntelliProp is where I would like to begin pursuing those passions professionally as a Hardware Developer.

\vspace{.6em}
As a college undergraduate entering my 4th and final year of education, I've learned a number of different skills that I could build upon as an embedded design engineer at IntelliProp. Verilog is my strongest hardware description language and C++, Java, and Python are the other programming languages I have worked with. I also have a basic working knowledge of KiCAD as I'm currently working on a PCB design project. Because I am still an undergraduate, I do not have much professional experience. However, I am ready and willing to learn the skills needed to succeed at IntelliProp. The skills I can offer are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Logic Design using Verilog on an FPGA}
  \item{Verilog Design Simulation using Xilinx ISE Design Suite}
  \item{Schematic and PCB Design using KiCAD and EAGLE}
  \item{Object-Oriented Programming in C/C++, Java, and Python}
  \item{Working Knowledge of Programming in Arduino}
  \item{Version Control using Git/Github}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.6em}
In my current position as a research assistant in Boston University's Space Technology Lab working on the ANDESITE project, I've used Atmel Studio to program and debug the Arduino chips on our node satellites, EAGLE to inspect the schematics and PCBs of the boards on our main and node satellites as well as create BOMs for those boards, as well as PyCharm to test and debug the main satellite's communication with our ground station.

Thank you for taking the time to consider me as a potential candidate and I hope we can meet in person so that we can start a conversation about how I can contribute to IntelliProp.
