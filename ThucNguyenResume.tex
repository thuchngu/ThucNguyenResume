\section{Projects}
\subsection{Lunar Atmospheric Cubesat Imaging System} \textit{Senior Design Project}

A prototype imaging system using COTS components designed to survive in lunar orbit inside a 3U cubesat form factor. The mission for the cubesat was to capture images of the lunar atmosphere with several levels of filtering in order to see the gradient of potassium and sodium particles in the lunar atmosphere.
\vspace{-.75em}
\subsection{Keyboard PCB} \textit{Personal Project}

A Work-in-progress mechanical keyboard PCB designed from scratch in KiCAD with a custom compact key layout designed in keyboard-layout-editor. The layout consists of the main alphabet section of a keyboard without the function row and the number row. It also has an isolated navigation cluster and a simple 10 key number pad.

\subsection{Simple Pipelined MIPS CPU} \textit{Final Project for Computer Orgainzation Course}

A simulated MIPS CPU that utilizes pipelining and is programmed using Verilog in XILINX ISE Design Suite. Contains a register file, an ALU, instruction memory, data memory, hazard detection and handling, and forwarding.
\vspace{-.75em}
\subsection{Lamp Post Mounted Flood Detector} \textit{Final Project for Engineering Design Course}

A water level detector composed of an arduino, an ultrasonic distance sensor, an XBee radio module, and a float switch. The system outputs the water level to a hypothetical relay station and then outputs a warning message once the level has reached or surpassed 1 ft.
\vspace{-.75em}
\subsection{Verilog Digital Lock} \textit{Final Project for Logic Design Course}

A digital lock that utilizes a seven-segment display and a series of switches on an FPGA board that allow a user to input a password to unlock the lock, change the password, and lock the digital lock. The lock was programmed in Verilog and simulated using Xilinx ISE Design Suite.
