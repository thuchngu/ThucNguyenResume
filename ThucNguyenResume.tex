\section{Education}
Boston University - \textit{Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering}

September 2016 - May 2020(anticipated)

GPA: 3.20/4.00

\section{Relevant Coursework}
Computer Architecture - Computer Organization - Introduction to Logic Design - Advanced Data Structures - Applied Algorithms - Introduction to Software Engineering - Introduction to Engineering Computation - Introduction to Electronics - Electric Circuits - Introduction to Engineering Design

\section{Projects}
\subsection{Custom Mechanical Keyboard} \textit{Personal Project}

A mechanical keyboard PCB designed from scratch in KiCAD with a custom layout designed in keyboard-layout-editor(project is still in progress).
\subsection{Lamp Post Mounted Flood Detector} \textit{Final Project for Engineering Design Course}

A water level detector composed of an arduino, an ultrasonic distance sensor, an XBee radio module, and a float switch. The system outputs the water level to a hypothetical relay station and then outputs a warning message once the level has reached or surpassed 1 ft.
\subsection{Verilog Digital Lock} \textit{Final Project for Logic Design Course}

A digital lock that utilizes a seven-segment display and a series of switches on an FPGA board that allow a user to input a password to unlock the lock, change the password, and lock the digital lock. The lock was programmed in Verilog and simulated using Xilinx ISE Design Suite.
